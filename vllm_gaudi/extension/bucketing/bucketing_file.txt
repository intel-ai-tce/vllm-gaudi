# This is a sample bucketing file

# Add buckets as follows:
# Prompt: (batch_size, query_len, context)
# Decode: (batch_size, 1, context)

# You can also use ranges to end up with Cartesian product like so:
# (1, [256, 512], [0, 4, 8])
# In this case you will end up with 6 buckets

# Not supported for unified attention buckets
# use '#' to comment out lines


# Buckets:
(1, 2048, 0)
(1, [256, 512], [0, 4, 8])

(64, 1, 1024)
(32, 1, 512)
(1, 1, range(256, 512, 32))
